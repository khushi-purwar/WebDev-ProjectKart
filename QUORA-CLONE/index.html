                    Cats are probably one of the most low maintenance pets you could have. That's not to say that they are no maintenance, but low maintenance. They barely need to be litter trained (just shown where the box is for the most part) and do not require outdoor walks. In fact, they shouldn't be taken outdoors. <br>Cats also provide endless entertainment! They can cuddle with you and purr and, in general, be adorable. :-). Our cats, Squishy and Waffles, bring us endless joy, reduce stress and improve our overall health.

                    I will choose the Internet any day, any time. Many great things have been invented in this world but none compares to the Internet. This have made the world a global village where information travels to a million miles just in a jiffy. If you want more of my explanations, consider this question have reached many great people all over the world through this same Internet. In my humble opinion, I think the Internet is the greatest thing humans ever invented that will, if not last forever, will hold the cards for many more generations to come.

                    I am from varanasi so I wanted wanted to join IT-BHU (now IIT BHU). I have also done Schooling from school affiliated with BHU. I appeared for JEE in 1993. Also appeared for entrance tests of Roorkee University and MNREC (NITs were known as REC). During that period total number of seats in IITs were around 1800, Roorkee 375 and MNREC (including seats of govt engg college) 1000. I selected for Roorkee Univ and MNREC. In Roorkee univ my rank was not good and I was only getting Civil, Industrial and Pulp and Paper.
                    <br>
                    Through MNREC I was getting all branches including CS in top RECs like Tricky, Warngal etc because very few students wanted to leave their home state and even parents were also not ready.

                    Becoming a mother, or a parent for that matter, is one of the most life altering experiences you can have. Many people dwell on the negative aspects of having to raise a child. I will not argue that it is a challenging job to undertake; it is a very big commitment to make, assuming that you want to be a GOOD parent! It can also be one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever have in your life.
                    <br>
                    It is important to set rules, limits and guidelines for your children so that they know what is expected of them. Children need parents who are consistent and mean what they say

                    I get asked a lot of questions, and most of them show someone didn't try to figure out an answer on their own before opening their mouth. That could be because they are unobservant, tend to speak before thinking, or have a second question they want to ask but need a way to introduce that topic.
                    <br>
                    The question I find the most irritating is when a roommate or partner looks at me, my silent, still body lying, eyes closed, on a piece of furniture intended for relaxation, and says, “Are you asleep?”

                  Recently accepted a role at Google.
                  <br>
                    My interview process:
                  <br>
                   1. Employee referral (CV referred by current Googler)  <br>
                   2. Phone Screen with recruiter <br>
                   3. Phone interview with current employee <br>
                   4. Flown to office for onsite, had 4 interviews in total (45 mins each) <br>
                   5. Interview feedback and CV sent for review by Hiring Committee <br>
                   6. Final reviews by SVP and senior leadership <br>
                   7. Recruiter called to extend offer… which I accepted  <br>
                   <br>
                    If you want a role, you should really get a current employee to refer you. With so many talented people applying for a limited pool of open roles it really helps your chances to speak with someone and not be lost in the system.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Over and over again, I see people in corner offices who, on paper, are of pretty mediocre intelligence.  <br>

                        If they were pitted against you on an academic test, most of you smart Quorans would best them fairly easily. <br>

                        And you know what? <br>

                        It means nothing. <br>

                        The moment you step out of academia and into the office, nothing you did in school matters anymore. <br>

                        Your SAT score. <br>

                        Your board rankings. <br>

                        Your perfect grades. <br>

                        They evaporate. Gone. They were the price of entry. <br>

                        Being smart certainly matters. It helps. <br>

                        But the longer you spend in the business world, the less you’ll see success manifesting itself as a product of smarts. <br>

                        You’ll someday realize that it was always just a contest of who wanted it the most.

                <p class="card-text">
                  It is very unfortunate that it takes a suicide of a celebrity actor who used to make his fans laugh, for people to start taking depression seriously. I have not checked the stats but there must have been millions of searches on google in the past 1 week to find out what depression really is and how it can take a toll on the life of a person who looks normal, wealthy and seems healthy and everything going well for him/her.
                  <br>
                  My answer will resonate well only with people who are suffering from depression or have recovered or are in the process of recovery.
                  <br>
                  Few readers may think that their problems are bigger than mine and there are people who suffer worse disease than depression - I completely agree with them and I would like to listen to their worries, fully empathize with them and will be there for them to support you - and at the same time, I also understand that most people don't understand what depression is as they are confused with routine sadness. The word 'depression' is taken very lightly these days.
                  <br>
                  Most people seem to confuse sadness with depression. They are two different emotions and that is where the problem is. When I lost my mother 9 years ago, I was very sad as it was a great personal loss, but I wasn't in depression - I was very active anyway.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    Folklore left me lost for words. I don’t know if this is a fan thing or whatever but Taylor has been my role model for many years, since I was 6 years old and first heard her song Love story on the radio. SInce then, I had researched everything about her, brought books about her and merch and went to almost every tour except reputation, because I was unavailable. One reason she is so special to me is because her albums are always released around the times where I feel those emotions the most in my life. It’s a very special thing and I wonder if all her fans can relate just like me.
                    <br>
                    Folklore came when I needed to hear those words. I felt like I could only trust myself and hearing those songs, those emotions slowly relieved themselves because I knew others were feeling the same way. I feel blessed to have had her songs at the right times in my life to keep me going.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    It's ending now and it's feeling horrid! He will not respect me, stays gone all weekend, without any explanation, never makes time for me, won't answer my phone calls or texts and chooses anyone before me. Basically, does not love me anymore.
                    <br>
                    Now, I believe in alone time, but 98 nights in 2 years seems a little ridiculous. I aired my disappointment, which he views as insults, and he then disappears again.
                    <br>
                    I am a great girlfriend, if I do say so. I cook, clean, work, cheer him up, ask him about his day, have gone fishing 100's of times, ( which I hate), do special things for him, compliment him, do his taxes and shopping,, and wash the cars and wax floors and always cover his butt, his body with blankets and his many disagreements with people.
                    <br>
                    I am thinking as hard as I can and I do not remember one time he did anything that he didn't want to do
                    
                    I am a friend, a lover, an adorer, and I encourage him to follow his dreams.
                    
                    I love his family, his laugh, his sweet smile and i have given him a beautiful home and a shoulder. A kiss good morning, and care and empathy when he doesn't feel well.
                    
                    But I am at the end of my rope. I'm the only one in this relationship, cuz he acts single. He comes and goes as he pleases. Mostly gone.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Doesn't exist. Perfection is manufactured man made state that we have conditioned society to believe as the ideal impression.
                  <br>
                      Under who's image? Those with power.
                  <br>
                      Hitler thought perfection was the Aryan race with blonde hair blue eyes. So he thought it was his duty to cull out every other race as it did not meet his perfect standards. This obviously is an extreme example but it does shed some truth about how much power dictates their own vision of what is perfect to them and the fragility of society can be so easily led by it.
                  <br>
                      In this day and age social media is the power that plays a strong influence on what people percieve as perfect. How many likes they get, trends, who's wearing what latest fashion, celebrity lifestyle, status, the type of careers based on what everyone else is doing or deemed “acceptable”. Rather than listening to their own voice and having a personal opinion to think for themselves.
                  <br>
                      Then we have parents & schools (not all but a lot) breathing down our necks about achieving perfect grades and doing well. And University, and our careers the expectations never end. Everything constantly changes at some point, and that includes expectations. Sure we have to reach a certain level of achievement to accomplish things, but perfect? What is that? Seems like an unrealistic endless bottom pit to me.
