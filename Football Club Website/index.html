            <p>Bruno Fernandes sent Paul Pogba a happy birthday message via social media – and couldn't help but reveal
                how much he misses his fellow midfielder out on the pitch. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted that Paul
                could be available for Thursday's Europa League second leg with AC Milan and, for Fernandes, it seems
                Pogba's return cannot come soon enough.</p>

            <h2>ABOUT US</h2><br><br>
            <p>Manchester United is the biggest most famous football club not only in England but worldwide. It has the
                largest fan base in the world with over 50 million supporters. They have had the greatest average
                attendance in England for 36 out of the last 40 years and their stadium old Trafford located in greater
                Manchester is consistently full to capacity for every home game which is about 76,000 fans. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>The club was founded in 1878 but not as Manchester United but as Newton Heath L & YR f.c. Newton Heath
                was a depot for the Lancashire and Yorkshire railways, and the club was set up as the workers football
                team. The team played on a small football pitch near Manchester Piccadilly station for 15 years before
                moving to Bank Street in 1893. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Sir Alex Ferguson took over Man Utd in 1986 and was giving the task of taking the club back to its former
                glory. In his first season they finished in 11th place and the pressure was mounting. Ferguson’s reign
                as United manager looked over in 1990 as united were not in contention for the league but thanks to Mark
                Hughes united went on to win the FA cup. </p>

        <p>Manchester united have the greatest fan base in the world but this was not always the case. In the early days
            before world war two, people in Manchester were neither man united fans nor man city fans as it was
            impossible to travel to away games they would just go the home matches and because their was only one home
            match every two weeks fans would go to either of the Manchester teams home matches.</p>

        <p>Exclusive ContentExternal Website Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is expecting the usual tricky test that a visit to
            Selhurst Park always seems to pose, but he insisted his Manchester United players will be especially spurred
            on by settling a score against Crystal Palace from the opening day of the season.</p>
